First clone, pull or download the "Test" folder into whatever location you like.
Second, go into eclipse, create a new project. Don't name the the project you created in eclipse with a project name
that already exists in your eclipse workspace.
Next, in that newly created project folder, right-click it and click "import". It will take you to an import page, under the availabel
options you'll see "General", under General, choose 
"File System". You'll be taken to a page to select where to import from. Next you'll choose the directory you saved the
github repo you cloned, pulled or downloaded and add that folder.
After selecting or adding it, before you click finish, where it says "Into folder" make sure it has the name of the new project you created earlier in eclipse.
Next click finish. It will load it up, it may or may not ask you to override some stuff but if it doesnt dont worry at all.
When its done loading, go to the newly created project folder and it should be there, go to src, com.main, and GameF22. Now right click and go to run configurations, you'll see run applet, try to run 
and hopefully it should work. Questions!!!?
